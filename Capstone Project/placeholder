The objective is to create a model using existing data to examine the correlation between Agent Bonuses and 
various independent variables. This involves conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) through univariate,
bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover relationships. The process includes data cleaning,
preprocessing, model construction, and validation, leading to final interpretations and recommendations. 
The aim is to design performance-based programs to incentivize agents effectively.
